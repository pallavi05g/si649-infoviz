SI 699 Information Visualization Project

This project deals with visualizing FBI Hate Crime data from the years 2013 to 2016 across states within the United States. 
On clicking a particular state on the first graph, the value is used to fetch corresponding state wise hate crime data. This will be used to render a second
graph that shows state wise distribution. The first graph that is a map visualization focuses on state versus country data and overall distribution
whereas the second one gives a user details about a particular state.
